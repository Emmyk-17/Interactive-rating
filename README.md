## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learnt how two give an elements two classes, the mobile-first workflow  

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<p class="name Emma">My name is Emmanuel</p>
```

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```
```js
const nam = document.queryselector(".name");
nam.addEventListener("click", ()=> {
  console.log ("clicked")
})
```

### Continued development

javascript functions and css grid
